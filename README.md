# Description

This game is inspired by an arcade game that I played in my youth - "Animalkaiser", along with another game that I had recently played - "Slay the Spire".
The reason why I chose to do this was because I had recalled an earlier lesson module done on Rock-Paper-Scissors game, noticing that the arcade game had a similar mechanic, I decided to add my spin on it with some elements from the game "Slay the Spire".

# How to Play
